Welcome to my personal profile website! This website is designed to showcase myself, my personality, education background, my hobbies, and a little something.
The website is divided into 4 pages, which can be accessed using the navigation bar at the top of the page. The pages include:

  Profile: The landing page, where it gives an introduction of me and what am I currently doing, this page also gives you more information about my personality based on 16 personality test [https://www.16personalities.com]

   FGO Servant Database : This is where the details is, I don't really know what to use about myself, so I pick Fate Grand Order Servants. Why? Idk they seems cool, so why not.

Design:

The website is designed to be chill and based on what my interest. I mainly focused on the dark blue, and used space theme images as the background to spice things up, the database mainly focused on blue as the display, which suits the atlas background, where I get the data of the servants. The site isn't made responsive, so it's better to view it on desktop on 100% zoom display.

Thanks for visiting my personal profile website, and I hope you find the information here useful and informative!
